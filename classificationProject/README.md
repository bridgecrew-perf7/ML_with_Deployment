# Project: University Student Admission Prediction Project 
> The goal of this project is to learn the implementation of classification Machine Learning algorithms in python. For this particular case, a simple project predicting the admission of a student in an american or canadian University is used.
> List of Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression.
- Decision Tree.
- Random Forest.
- XGBoost.
- K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Support Vector Machines.
- Naive Bayes.
- Linear Discriminant Analysis.
> Hyperparameter tunning and Ensemble techniques like Passing, Pagging and K-fold Cross Validation are also used.

## General Information
The goal of this project is to predict the admission of a student in an University taking into account the following points:
- General test score (GRE).
- Test of English as a Foreign Languge score (TOEFL).
- University rating.
- Statement of Purpose (SOP).
- Letter of Recommendation (LOR). 
- Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).

Purpose: Practice the implementation of the Linear Regression Machine Learning Model till deployment (Google Cloud).

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement
The classification algorithms are used for learning purposes but for sure the model can be tested and improved with other Machine Learning Algorithms.
